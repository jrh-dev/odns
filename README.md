A package for exploring and obtaining data available through the [Scottish Health and Social Care Open Data platform](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/). The package interacts with the underlying [CKAN](https://ckan.org) API and simplifies the process of accessing the available data with R.

`odns` allows users to quickly explore the available data and start using it without having to write complex queries.

## Installation

Install `odns` from GitHub;

```
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/jrh-dev/odns")
```

Or, install from source:

1.  Click the 'Code' button at the top of the repository and choose 'Download ZIP' from the drop-down menu.

2.  Unzip the downloaded file.

3.  Install;

```
install.packages("<path/to/file>", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

## Usage

### Exploring the available data

To view the packages available;

```
all_packages()
  
#  [1] "18-weeks-referral-to-treatment"                                                             
#  [2] "27-30-month-review-statistics"                                                              
#  [3] "alcohol-related-hospital-statistics-scotland"                                               
#  [4] "allied-health-professionals-musculoskeletal-waiting-times"                                  
#  [5] "allied-health-professional-vacancies"
#  ...
```

Or, to search for packages whose names contain a certain string;

```
all_packages(contains = "population")

#  [1] "gp-practice-populations" "population-estimates"   
#  [3] "population-projections"  "standard-populations"
```

To view details of the available resources;

```
# view all resources under packages whose names contain "population"
all_resources(package_contains = "population")

#                                   name            package_name
# 1   GP Practice Populations April 2022 gp-practice-populations
# 2 GP Practice Populations January 2022 gp-practice-populations
#                                     id
# 1 2c701f90-c26d-4963-8062-95b8611e5fd1
# 2 d07debcf-7832-4dc4-afb2-41101d5cc7ff
#                             package_id
# 1 e3300e98-cdd2-4f4e-a24e-06ee14fcc66c
# 2 e3300e98-cdd2-4f4e-a24e-06ee14fcc66c
#                last_modified
# 1 2022-05-10T09:43:24.390241
# 2 2022-02-07T11:13:52.195764

# view all resources, regardless of containing package, whose names contain "European"
all_resources(resource_contains = "European")

# view all resources under packages whose names contain "population" and where the package name contains contain "European"
all_resources(package_contains = "population", resource_contains = "european")

```

When search terms are used, they are case insensitive.

### Viewing package and resource metadata

Package and resource metadata contains useful information about the available data. To view metadata;

```
# view metadata for a package
# using a valid package name
package_metadata(package = "standard-populations")

# using a valid package id
package_metadata(package = "4dd86111-7326-48c4-8763-8cc4aa190c3e")

# view metadata for a resource
# using a valid resource id
resource_metadata(resource="edee9731-daf7-4e0d-b525-e4c1469b8f69")
```

### Importing data to R

To import all resources within a package;

```
# get full data-sets
get_resource(package = "4dd86111-7326-48c4-8763-8cc4aa190c3e")

# get the first 10 rows of each data-set
get_resource(package = "4dd86111-7326-48c4-8763-8cc4aa190c3e", limit = 10L)
```

To import specific resources within a package;

```
get_dataset(
   package = "4dd86111-7326-48c4-8763-8cc4aa190c3e",
   resource = "edee9731-daf7-4e0d-b525-e4c1469b8f69",
   limit = 5L
   )
```

It is also possible to utilise the underlying CKAN API to extract more specific subsets of the full resources available.

```
# import specified fields from a data set
get_data(
   resource = "edee9731-daf7-4e0d-b525-e4c1469b8f69",
   fields = c("AgeGroup", "EuropeanStandardPopulation")
 )

# import specified fields from a data set utilising a SQL style where query
get_data(
   resource = "edee9731-daf7-4e0d-b525-e4c1469b8f69",
   fields = c("AgeGroup", "EuropeanStandardPopulation"),
   where = "\"AgeGroup\" = \'45-49 years\'"
 )
 ```
 
#### Correct formatting for SQL
 
The option provided by the `get_data()` function to specify a `where` argument requires specific formatting for compatibility with the CKAN API. Field names must be double quoted `"`, non-numeric values must be single quoted `"`, and both single and double quotes must be delimited. Example; `where = "\"AgeGroup\" = \'45-49 years\\'"`.
